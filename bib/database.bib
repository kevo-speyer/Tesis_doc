  abstract = {Responsive polymers attached to the inside of nano/micro-pores have
	attracted great interest owing to the prospect of designing flow-control
	devices and signal responsive delivery systems. An intriguing possibility
	involves functionalizing nanoporous materials with smart polymers
	to modulate biomolecular transport in response to pH, temperature,
	ionic concentration, light or electric field. These efforts open
	up avenues to develop smart medical devices that respond to specific
	physiological conditions. In this work, an overview of nanoporous
	materials functionalized with responsive polymers is given. Various
	examples of pH, temperature and solvent responsive polymers are discussed.
	A theoretical treatment that accounts for polymer conformational
	change in response to a stimulus and the associated flow-control
	effect is presented.},

	ingredients that differentiate droplet microfluidics from single-phase
	microfluidics{,} namely the modifications to the flow and pressure
	fields that are introduced by the presence of interfacial tension.
	Then three practical aspects are studied in detail: (i) The formation
	of drops and the dominant interactions depending on the geometry
	in which they are formed. (ii) The transport of drops{,} namely the
	evaluation of drop velocity{,} the pressure-velocity relationships{,}
	and the flow field induced by the presence of the drop. (iii) The
	fusion of two drops{,} including different methods of bridging the
	liquid film between them which enables their merging.},

  abstract = { High thermal conductivity is helpful for thermal control and management,
	and superhydrophobicity can benefit fluid friction reduction and
	liquid droplet control in micro-/nanodevices. We report on a nano-molding
	technique that can prepare polyethylene nanowire arrays with high
	thermal conductivity (more than 10 W/m-K) and superhydrophobicity
	(contact angle >150). The thermal conductivities of the fabricated
	high-density polyethylene nanowire arrays with diameters of 100 nm
	and 200 nm, measured by a laser flash method, are about 2 orders
	of magnitude higher than their bulk counterparts. The estimated thermal
	conductivity of a single high-density polyethylene nanowire is as
	high as 26.5 W/m-K at room temperature, while the thermal conductivity
	of low-density polyethylene nanowire is a little smaller. The self-organized
	surfaces of polymer nanowire arrays are found to have micro-to-nanoscale
	hierarchical nanostructures, and have superhydrophobicity of greater
	than 150  contact angles for water. We also measure the wettability
	of organic liquids, including glycerin, ethanol, paraffin liquid,
	and methyl silicone oil. We find glycerin gives hydrophobic wettability,
	but the others give hydrophilic wettabilities. This technique is
	promising for fabrication due to the advantages of simple fabrication,
	high quality, low cost, and mass production. },

  abstract = {Abstract The glycocalyx is a sugar-rich layer located at the luminal
	part of the endothelial cells. It is involved in key metabolic processes
	and its malfunction is related to several diseases. To understand
	the function of the glycocalyx, a molecular level characterization
	is necessary. In this article, we present large-scale molecular-dynamics
	simulations that provide a comprehensive description of the structure
	and dynamics of the glycocalyx. We introduce the most detailed, to-date,
	all-atom glycocalyx model, composed of lipid bilayer, proteoglycan
	dimers, and heparan sulfate chains with realistic sequences. Our
	results reveal the folding of proteoglycan ectodomain and the extended
	conformation of heparan sulfate chains. Furthermore, we study the
	glycocalyx response under shear flow and its role as a flypaper for
	binding fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which are involved in diverse
	functions related to cellular differentiation, including angiogenesis,
	morphogenesis, and wound healing. The simulations show that the glycocalyx
	increases the effective concentration of FGFs, leading to \{FGF\}
	oligomerization, and acts as a lever to transfer mechanical stimulus
	into the cytoplasmic side of endothelial cells. },

  abstract = {Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes are a special class of polymer brushes
	(PBs) containing charges. Polymer chains attain {"}brush{"}-like
	configuration when they are grafted or get localized at an interface
	(solid-fluid or liquid-fluid) with sufficiently close proximity between
	two-adjacent grafted polymer chains - such a proximity triggers a
	particular nature of interaction between the adjacent polymer molecules
	forcing them to stretch orthogonally to the grafting interface{,}
	instead of random-coil arrangement. In this review{,} we discuss
	the theory{,} synthesis{,} and applications of PE brushes. The theoretical
	discussion starts with the standard scaling concepts for polymer
	and PE brushes; following that{,} we shed light on the state of the
	art in continuum modelling approaches for polymer and PE brushes
	directed towards analysis beyond the scaling calculations. A special
	emphasis is laid in pinpointing the cases for which the PE electrostatic
	effects can be de-coupled from the PE entropic and excluded volume
	effects; such de-coupling is necessary to appropriately probe the
	complicated electrostatic effects arising from pH-dependent charging
	of the PE brushes and the use of these effects for driving liquid
	and ion transport at the interfaces covered with PE brushes. We also
	discuss the atomistic simulation approaches for polymer and PE brushes.
	Next we provide a detailed review of the existing approaches for
	the synthesis of polymer and PE brushes on interfaces{,} nanoparticles{,}
	and nanochannels{,} including mixed brushes and patterned brushes.
	Finally{,} we discuss some of the possible applications and future

  abstract = {Propulsion by cilia is a fascinating and universal mechanism in biological
	organisms to generate fluid motion on the cellular level. Cilia are
	hair-like organelles, which are found in many different tissues and
	many uni- and multicellular organisms. Assembled in large fields,
	cilia beat neither randomly nor completely synchronously-instead
	they display a striking self-organization in the form of metachronal
	waves (MCWs). It was speculated early on that hydrodynamic interactions
	provide the physical mechanism for the synchronization of cilia motion.
	Theory and simulations of physical model systems, ranging from arrays
	of highly simplified actuated particles to a few cilia or cilia chains,
	support this hypothesis. The main questions are how the individual
	cilia interact with the flow field generated by their neighbors and
	synchronize their beats for the metachronal wave to emerge and how
	the properties of the metachronal wave are determined by the geometrical
	arrangement of the cilia, like cilia spacing and beat direction.
	Here, we address these issues by large-scale computer simulations
	of a mesoscopic model of 2D cilia arrays in a 3D fluid medium. We
	show that hydrodynamic interactions are indeed sufficient to explain
	the self-organization of MCWs and study beat patterns, stability,
	energy expenditure, and transport properties. We find that the MCW
	can increase propulsion velocity more than 3-fold and efficiency
	almost 10-fold-compared with cilia all beating in phase. This can
	be a vital advantage for ciliated organisms and may be interesting
	to guide biological experiments as well as the design of efficient
	microfluidic devices and artificial microswimmers.},

	in opposing directions. Our analysis suggests that the difference
	between the retention force in one direction versus the other can
	be maximized by increasing feature asymmetry and minimizing inherent
	hysteresis of the materials of construction. This work has implications
	for small channels or surfaces of fluid-handling components found
	in microfluidic devices and fuel cells. },

  abstract = {Abstract Microfluidic schemes for forming uniform aqueous microdroplets
	usually rely on contacting the aqueous liquid (dispersed phase) with
	an immiscible oil (continuous phase). Here, we demonstrate that the
	oil can be substituted with gas (nitrogen or air) while still retaining
	the ability to generate discrete and uniform aqueous droplets. Our
	device is a capillary co-flow system, with the inner flow of water
	getting periodically dispersed into droplets by the external flow
	of gas. The droplet size and different formation modes can be tuned
	by varying the liquid and gas flow rates. Importantly, we identify
	the range of conditions that correspond to the "dripping mode", i.e.,
	where discrete droplets are consistently generated with no satellites.
	We believe this is a significant development that will be beneficial
	for chemical and biological applications requiring clean and contaminant-free
	droplets, including \{DNA\} amplification, drug encapsulation, and
	microfluidic cell culture. },

  abstract = {The glycocalyx has a prominent role in orchestrating multiple biological
	processes occurring at the plasma membrane. In this paper, an all-atom
	flow/glycocalyx system is constructed with the bulk flow velocity
	in the physiologically relevant ranges for the first time. The system
	is simulated by molecular dynamics using 5.8 million atoms. Flow
	dynamics and statistics in the presence of the glycocalyx are presented
	and discussed. Complex dynamic behaviours of the glycocalyx, particularly
	the sugar chains, are observed in response to blood flow. In turn,
	the motion of the glycocalyx, including swing and swirling, disturbs
	the flow by altering the velocity profiles and modifying the vorticity
	distributions. As a result, the initially one-dimensional forcing
	is spread to all directions in the region near the endothelial cell
	surface. Furthermore, the coupled dynamics exist not only between
	the flow and the glycocalyx but also within the glycocalyx molecular
	constituents. Shear stress distributions between one-dimer and three-dimer
	cases are also conducted. Finally, potential force transmission pathways
	are discussed based on the dynamics of the glycocalyx constituents,
	which provides new insight into the mechanism of mechanotransduction
	of the glycocalyx. These findings have relevance in the pathologies
	of glycocalyx-related diseases, for example in renal or cardiovascular
	conditions.},

	in a Microchannel},
  journal = {Micromachines},
  year = {2016},
  volume = {7},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Microfluidics has been used to perform various chemical operations
	for pL-nL volumes of samples, such as mixing, reaction and separation,
	by exploiting diffusion, viscous forces, and surface tension, which
	are dominant in spaces with dimensions on the micrometer scale. To
	further develop this field, we previously developed a novel microfluidic
	device, termed a microdroplet collider, which exploits spatially
	and temporally localized kinetic energy. This device accelerates
	a microdroplet in the gas phase along a microchannel until it collides
	with a target. We demonstrated 6000-fold faster mixing compared to
	mixing by diffusion; however, the droplet acceleration was not optimized,
	because the experiments were conducted for only one droplet size
	and at pressures in the 10--100 kPa range. In this study, we investigated
	the acceleration of a microdroplet using a high-pressure (MPa) control
	system, in order to achieve higher acceleration and kinetic energy.
	The motion of the nL droplet was observed using a high-speed complementary
	metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) camera. A maximum droplet velocity
	of ~5 m/s was achieved at a pressure of 1--2 MPa. Despite the higher
	fluid resistance, longer droplets yielded higher acceleration and
	kinetic energy, because droplet splitting was a determining factor
	in the acceleration and using a longer droplet helped prevent it.
	The results provide design guidelines for achieving higher kinetic
	energies in the microdroplet collider for various microfluidic applications.},

  abstract = {This review compiles recent theoretical advances to describe compressive
	and shear forces of polymer-brush bilayers{,} which consist of two
	opposing brushes in contact. Such model systems for polymer-brush
	lubrication are frequently used as a benchmark to gain insight into
	biological problems{,} e.g.{,} synovial joint lubrication. Based
	on scaling theory{,} I derive conformational and collective properties
	of polymer-brush bilayers in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium situations{,}
	such as shear forces in the linear and nonlinear response regimes
	of stationary shear and under non-stationary shear. Furthermore{,}
	I discuss the influence of macromolecular inclusions and electrostatic
	interactions on polymer-brush lubrication. Comparisons to alternative
	analytical approaches{,} experiments and numerical results are performed.
	Special emphasis is given to methods for simulating polymer-brush
	bilayers using molecular dynamics simulations.},

	flows of solvents and water. Annular flow of nitrogen gas and a Teflon
	AF (DuPont) dispersion enable controlled evaporation of fluoropolymer
	solvent, which in turn brings about three-dimensional polymer deposition
	on microchannel walls. Consequently, the wetting behavior is switched
	from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Analysis of microreactors reveals
	that the polymer layer thickness increases down the length of the
	reactor from ~1 to ~13 $\mu m$  with an average thickness of ~7 $\mu m$. Similarly,
	we show that microreactor surfaces can be modified with poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
	(PTFE). These PTFE-coated microreactors are further characterized
	by measuring residence time distributions in segmented liquid liquid
	multiphase flows, which display reduced axial dispersion for the
	coated microreactors. Applying particle image velocimetry, changes
	in segment shape and velocity fluctuations are observed resulting
	in reduced axial dispersion. Furthermore, the segment size distribution
	is narrowed for the hydrophobic microreactors, enabling further control

  abstract = {The equilibrium and flow of polymer films and drops past a surface
	are characterized by the interface and surface tensions, viscosity,
	slip length and hydrodynamic boundary position. These parameters
	of the continuum description are extracted from molecular simulations
	of coarse-grained models. Hard, corrugated substrates are modelled
	by a Lennard-Jones solid while polymer brushes are studied as prototypes
	of soft, deformable surfaces. Four observations are discussed. (i)??If
	the surface becomes strongly attractive or is coated with a brush,
	the Navier boundary condition fails to describe the effect of the
	surface independently of the strength and type of the flow. This
	failure stems from the formation of a boundary layer with an effective,
	higher viscosity. (ii)??In the case of brush-coated surfaces, flow
	induces a cyclic, tumbling motion of the tethered chain molecules.
	Their collective motion gives rise to an inversion of the flow in
	the vicinity of the grafting surfaces and leads to strong, non-Gaussian
	fluctuations of the molecular orientations. The flow past a polymer
	brush cannot be described by Brinkman's equation. (iii)??The hydrodynamic
	boundary condition is an important parameter for predicting the motion
	of polymer droplets on a surface under the influence of an external
	force. Their steady-state velocity is dictated by a balance between
	the power that is provided by the external force and the dissipation.
	If there is slippage at the liquid???solid interface, the friction
	at the solid???liquid interface and the viscous dissipation of the
	flow inside the drop will be the dominant dissipation mechanisms;
	dissipation at the three-phase contact line appears to be less important
	on a hard surface. (iv)??On a soft, deformable substrate like a polymer
	brush, we observe a lifting-up of the three-phase contact line. Controlling
	the grafting density and the incompatibility between the brush and
	the polymer liquid we can independently tune the softness of the
	surface and the contact angle and thereby identify the parameters
	for maximizing the deformation at the three-phase contact.},

	channels of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) plays a
	critical role in proper water management. In this work, the two-phase
	flow in \{PEMFC\} cathode parallel channels is studied over a wide
	range of superficial air velocity (air stoichiometry) and superficial
	water velocity in a specially designed ex situ experimental setup,
	which enables the measurement of instantaneous flow rates in individual
	gas channels and simultaneous visualization of the water flow structure.
	It is found that the two-phase flow at low superficial air velocities
	(air stoichiometry below 5) is dominated by slugs or semi-slugs,
	leading to severe flow maldistribution and large fluctuations in
	the pressure drop. Slug residence time, measured from the video observation
	and the instantaneous flow rate data, is found to be a new parameter
	to describe the slug flow. At higher air velocities, a water film
	is formed on the channel walls if they are hydrophilic. The pressure
	drop for the film flow is characterized by smaller but frequent fluctuations,
	which are found to result from the water buildup at the channel-exit
	manifold interface. As the superficial air velocity increases further,
	mist flow is obtained where little water buildup is observed. The
	water buildup in the gas channels at the two-phase flow is well described
	by the two-phase friction multiplier, defined as the ratio of the
	two-phase pressure drop to the single gas phase pressure drop. It
	is found that the two-phase friction multiplier increases with increasing
	water flow rate. A flow pattern map is developed using superficial
	water and air velocities with clearly defined transition regions.

  abstract = {Tailoring surface interactions or grafting of polymers onto surfaces
	is a versatile tool for controlling wettability, lubrication, adhesion

	simulations, we investigate how structural changes near the surface
	affect the flow of a polymer melt over the surface and how these
	changes can be parameterized by a hydrodynamiZhuc boundary condition.
	We study the temperature dependence of the near-surface flow of a
	polymer melt at a corrugated, attractive surface. At weakly attractive
	surfaces, lubrication layers form, the slip length is large and increases
	upon cooling. Close to the glass transition temperature, very large
	slip lengths are observed. At a more attractive surface, a 'sticky
	surface layer' is build up, giving rise to a small slip length. Upon
	cooling, the slip length decreases at high temperatures, passes through
	a minimum and increases upon approaching the glass transition temperature.
	At strongly attractive surfaces, the Navier slip condition fails
	to describe Couette and Poiseuille flows simultaneously. A similar
	failure of the Navier slip condition is observed for the flow of
	a polymer melt over a brush comprised of identical molecules. The
	wetting and flow properties of this surface are rather complex. Most
	notably, the cyclic motion of the grafted molecules gives rise to
	a reversal of the flow direction at the grafting surface. The failure
	of the Navier slip condition in both cases can be rationalized within
	a schematic, two-layer model, which demonstrates that the Navier
	slip condition fails to simultaneously describe Poiseuille and Couette
	flow if the fluid at the surface exhibits a higher viscosity than

  abstract = {Using a coarse-grained bead-spring model for semi-flexible macromolecules
	which form a polymer brush{,} the structure and dynamics of the polymers
	were investigated{,} varying the chain stiffness and the grafting
	density. The anchoring conditions for the grafted chains were chosen
	such that their first bonds were oriented along the normal to the
	substrate plane. The compression of such a semi-flexible brush by
	a planar piston was observed to be a two-stage process: for a small
	compression the chains were shown to contract by {"}buckling{"} deformation
	whereas for a larger compression the chains exhibited a collective
	(almost uniform) bending deformation. Thus{,} the stiff polymer brush
	underwent a 2nd order phase transition of collective bond reorientation.
	The pressure{,} required to keep the stiff brush at a given degree
	of compression{,} was thereby significantly smaller than for an otherwise
	identical brush made of entirely flexible polymer chains! While both
	the brush height and the chain linear dimensions in the z-direction
	perpendicular to the substrate increased monotonically with an increase
	in the chain stiffness{,} the lateral (xy) chain linear dimensions
	exhibited a maximum at an intermediate chain stiffness. Increasing
	the grafting density led to a strong decrease of these lateral dimensions
	which is compatible with an exponential decay. Also the recovery
	kinetics after removal of the compressing piston were studied{,}
	and were found to follow a power-law/exponential decay with time.
	A simple mean-field theoretical consideration{,} accounting for the
	buckling/bending behavior of semi-flexible polymer brushes under
	compression was suggested.},

	the case where the first bond must orient perpendicularly to the

	perpendicular to the surface. In this stage the pressure rises rapidly,
	and the components of the last bond vectors in the plane parallel
	to the compressing piston remain randomly oriented. ii) For larger
	compression, the pressure decreases after a slight overshot, and
	then stays constant before the pressure starts to slowly rise again.
	In this stage, the bond vector components (of the bonds adjacent
	to the compressing piston) exhibit a symmetry breaking, XY -model???like
	orientational order develops, which then determines the orientation

  abstract = { The nanotribological properties of hydrophilic polymer brushes are
	conveniently analyzed by lateral force microscopy (LFM). However,
	the measurement of friction for highly swollen and relatively thick
	polymer brushes can be strongly affected by the tendency of the compliant
	brush to be laterally deformed by the shearing probe. This phenomenon
	induces a "tilting" in the recorded friction loops, which is generated
	by the lateral bending and stretching of the grafts. In this study
	we highlight how the brush lateral deformation mainly affects the
	friction measurements of swollen PNIPAM brushes (below LCST) when
	relatively short scanning distances are applied. Under these conditions,
	the energy dissipation recorded by LFM is almost uniquely determined
	by stretching and bending of the compliant brush back and forth along
	the scanning direction, and it is not correlated to dynamic friction
	between two sliding surfaces. In contrast, when the scanning distance
	applied during LFM is relevantly longer than the brush lateral deformation,
	sliding of the probe on the brush interface becomes dominant, and
	a correct measurement of dynamic friction can be accomplished. By
	increasing the temperature above the LCST, the PNIPAM brushes undergo
	dehydration and assume a collapsed morphology, thereby hindering
	their lateral deformation by scanning probe. Hence, at 40 C in water
	the recorded friction loops do not show any tilting and LFM accurately
	describes the dynamic friction between the probe and the polymer
	surface. },

  abstract = {Capillary hydrodynamics has three considerable distinctions from macrosystems:
	first, there is an increase in the ratio of the surface area of the
	phases to the volume that they occupy; second, a flow is characterized
	by small Reynolds numbers at which viscous forces predominate over
	inertial forces; and third, the microroughness and wettability of
	the wall of the channel exert a considerable influence on the flow
	pattern. In view of these differences, the correlations used for
	tubes with a larger diameter cannot be used to calculate the boundaries
	of the transitions between different flow regimes in microchannels.
	In the present review, an analysis of published data on a gas liquid
	two-phase flow in capillaries of various shapes is given, which makes
	it possible to systematize the collected body of information. The
	specific features of the geometry of a mixer and an inlet section,
	the hydraulic diameter of a capillary, and the surface tension of
	a liquid exert the strongest influence on the position of the boundaries
	of two-phase flow regimes. Under conditions of the constant geometry
	of the mixer, the best agreement in the position of the boundaries
	of the transitions between different hydrodynamic regimes in capillaries
	is observed during the construction of maps of the regimes with the
	use of the Weber numbers for a gas and a liquid as coordinate axes.},

	the various parameters that have been studied in the literature,
	channel size, phase superficial velocities, liquid phase surface

	the patterns but to a lesser degree. Liquid viscosity and flow orientation
	with respect to gravity also seemed to play some role but the results
	were not conclusive. A universal flow regime map does not seem to

	used in the various studies as well as to the effects of wall properties,

	case involving non-oscillatory flow. A simple theoretical model that

  abstract = {For a one-component fluid on a solid substrate, a thermal singularity
	may occur at the contact line where the liquid–vapor interface intersects
	the solid surface. Physically, the liquid–vapor interface is almost
	isothermal at the liquid–vapor coexistence temperature in one-component
	fluids while the solid surface is almost isothermal for solids of
	high thermal conductivity. Therefore, a temperature discontinuity
	is formed if the two isothermal interfaces are of different temperatures
	and intersect at the contact line. This leads to the so-called thermal
	singularity. The localized hydrodynamics involving evaporation/condensation
	near the contact line leads to a contact angle depending on the underlying
	substrate temperature. This dependence has been shown to lead to
	the motion of liquid droplets on solid substrates with thermal gradients
	(Xu and Qian 2012 Phys. Rev. E 85 061603). In the present work, we
	carry out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as numerical experiments
	to further confirm the predictions made from our previous continuum
	hydrodynamic modeling and simulations, which are actually semi-quantitatively
	accurate down to the small length scales in the problem. Using MD
	simulations, we investigate the motion of evaporative droplets in
	one-component Lennard-Jones fluids confined in nanochannels with
	thermal gradients. The droplet is found to migrate in the direction
	of decreasing temperature of solid walls, with a migration velocity
	linearly proportional to the temperature gradient. This agrees with
	the prediction of our continuum model. We then measure the effect
	of droplet size on the droplet motion. It is found that the droplet
	mobility is inversely proportional to a dimensionless coefficient
	associated with the total rate of dissipation due to droplet movement.
	Our results show that this coefficient is of order unity and increases
	with the droplet size for the small droplets (∼10 nm) simulated in
	the present work. These findings are in semi-quantitative agreement
	with the predictions of our continuum model. Finally, we measure
	the effect of liquid–vapor coexistence temperature on the droplet
	motion. Through a theoretical analysis on the size of the thermal
	singularity, it can be shown that the droplet mobility decreases
	with decreasing coexistence temperature. This is observed in our
	MD simulations.},

  abstract = {This study performed the molecular dynamic simulations to investigate
	the boundary behavior of liquid water with entrapped gas bubbles
	over various hydrophilic roughened substrates. A ``liquid--gas--vapor
	coexistence setup'' was employed to maintain a constant thermodynamic
	state during individual equilibrium simulations and corresponding
	non-equilibrium Poiseuille flow cases. The two roughened substrates
	(Si(100) and graphite) adopted in this study present similar contact
	angles and slip length with gas-free fluid. By considering the effects
	of argon molecules at the interface, we demonstrated that the boundary
	slip behavior differed dramatically between these two rough wall
	channels. This divergence can be attributed to differences in the
	morphology of argon bubble at the interface due to discrepancies
	in the atomic arrangement and wall--fluid interaction energy. Furthermore,
	the density of gas at the interface had a significant impact on the
	effective slip length of the roughened graphite substrate, whereas
	shear rate {\$}{\$}{\backslash}dot{\{}{\backslash}gamma {\}}{\$}{\$}
	$\gamma$ ˙ presented no noticeable influence. On the roughened Si(100)
	surface, the morphology of the argon bubbles exhibited far higher
	meniscus curvature and unstable properties under hydrodynamic effects.
	Thus, this substrate exhibited no slip to slight negative slip and
	no remarkable influence from either the density of gas at the interface
	or shear rate. In the present study, we demonstrate that the morphology
	and behavior of interfacial gas bubbles are influenced by the parameters
	of wall--fluid interaction as well as the atomic arrangement of the
	substrate. Our results related to nanochannel flow reveal that different
	surfaces, such as Si(100) and graphite, may possess similar intrinsic
	wettability; however, properties of the interfacial gas bubbles can
	lead to noticeable changes in interfacial characteristics resulting
	in various degrees of boundary slippage.},

  abstract = { ABSTRACTIn the present study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation
	was used to investigate the relationship between wetting behaviour
	and slip length on patterned substrates. We adopted two solid surfaces
	of Si(100) and graphite due to similarities in their intrinsic contact
	angle. Contact angle and apparent slip length were obtained using
	discrete simulations with the same thermodynamic states. In the present
	study, a number of questions regarding surface roughness and the
	problem of contact angle (θ) and slip length (Ls) are discussed.
	These questions include the relationship between θ and surface roughness,
	the characteristics used to describe the difference between static
	and dynamic fluid fields and the reason for a lack of multilayer
	sticking observed in the current cases. Our results indicate that
	the quasi-universal θ − Ls equation proposed by Hung et al. (2008)
	is applicable to cases involving a Cassie-like nanoscale roughened
	surface. In contrast, in cases with a Wenzel-like nanostructure,
	the no-slip boundary conditions are independent of variations in
	the contact angle. The adoption of a Wenzel–Cassie hybrid model helped
	to verify that the fluid density inside the cavity is a critical
	indicator of wettability of the wall–fluid interface. Our results
	also demonstrate that ρf, cav is a critical property in the measurement
	of hydrodynamic effects and thus its importance as an indicator of
	the validity of the equation θ − Ls. The average time that water
	molecules are trapped and the number of averaged hydrogen bonds within
	cavities in a dynamic fluid field were also investigated.  },

	of liquid water removal from the GDL surface identified: one through
	droplet detachment by the shear force of the core gas flow followed
	by a mist flow in the gas channel, and the other by capillary wicking
	onto the more hydrophilic channel walls followed by the annular film
	flow and/or liquid slug flow in the channel. In the former regime,
	typical of high gas flow rates, the droplet detachment diameter is
	correlated well with the mean gas velocity in the channel. In the

	over hydrophilic channel surfaces and drainage via corner flow were

	with only a minimum pressure drop required to drive the oxidizer

Both single-end-grafted, "brushes", and twice-grafted layer are considered. We find that the polymer brush collapses uniformly, density variations in the direction parallel to the grafting plane being smoothed out by the positive osmotic pressure in the layer. The twice-grafted layer cannot collapse like a brush, and an instability in the mean-field solution to a novel "bundled" state is found. The characteristic bundle size is set by the amplitude of transverse fluctuations of individual stretched chains in the layer.}

abstract = {Single solid-state nanopores modified with poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) brushes display thermally controlled gating properties. Below the lower critical solubility temperature (LCST) NIPAM brushes are swollen and, consequently, dramatically reduce the effective cross section of the nanopores (see image). Conversely, above the LCST the brushes dehydrate and suffer a transition into a collapsed state, which promotes the widening of the nanopore and enables a substantial flow of ions.}

abstract  ="We study by coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations the liquid flow in a slit channel with the inner walls coated by semiflexible polymer brushes. The distance between walls is close enough such that polymers grafted to opposing walls interact among each other and form bundles across the channel in poor solvent conditions. The solvent is simulated explicitly{,} including particles that fill the interior of the channel. The system is studied in equilibrium and under flow{,} by applying a constant body force on each particle of the system. A non-linear relation between external force and flow rate is observed{,} for a particular set of parameters. This non-linear response is linked to a morphological change of the polymer brushes. For large enough forces{,} the bundle structures formed across the channel break as the chains lean in the direction of the flow{,} and clear the middle of the channel. This morphological alteration of the polymer configurations translates in a sudden increase in the flow rate{,} acting as a pressure-responsive gate. The relation between flow and external force is investigated for various parameters{,} such as grafting density{,} quality of the solvent and polymer bending rigidity. We observe a non-monotonic dependence of the flow as a function of the polymer rigidity{,} and find an optimum value for the persistence length. We also find that the force threshold at which the morphological changes happen in the polymer brush{,} depends linearly on the grafting density. These findings can lead to new flow control techniques in micro and nano-fluidic devices."}

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the spreading characteristics of nano-sized droplets on solid surfaces. The spreading behavior was analyzed in terms of the temporal evolution of the dynamic contact angle and spreading diameter for wettable, partially wettable and non-wettable surfaces. The computational model was validated through qualitative comparison with the measurements of Bayer and Megaridis, and through comparison with existing correlations. The comparison based on the ratio of relevant time scales indicated that for the conditions investigated, the spreading dynamics is governed by inertial and surface forces, with negligible influence of viscous forces. In addition, the simulation results indicated that the dynamic contact angle and spreading diameter, as well as the advancing and receding time periods, exhibit strong dependence on droplet size. These results were further analyzed to obtain correlations for the effect of droplet size on these spreading parameters. The correlations indicated that the normalized spreading diameter and contact angle scale with drop diameter as Dm /D0 ∝D00.5 and θR ∝D00.5, while the advancing and receding time periods scale as t∝D02/3. Global kinetic energy and surface energy considerations were used to provide a physical basis for these correlations. The correlations were also found to be generally consistent with the experimentally observed spreading behavior of macroscopic droplets.}

  abstract={The stochastic differential equations corresponding to the updating algorithm of Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), and the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation are derived. It is shown that a slight modification to the algorithm is required before the Gibbs distribution is recovered as the stationary solution to the Fokker-Planck equation. The temperature of the system is then directly related to the noise amplitude by means of a fluctuation-dissipation theorem. However, the correspondingly modified, discrete DPD algorithm is only found to obey these predictions if the length of the time step is sufficiently reduced. This indicates the importance of time discretisation in DPD.}

abstract = "Various mechanisms of solid--solid and solid--liquid friction are studied in this review, and their relation to the surface roughness hierarchy is discussed. For ideal solid bodies with conservative forces acting between them, there would be no friction. Different deviations from the ideal state, such as the surface roughness, contamination and chemical heterogeneity, bulk material deformation and non-conservative adhesive bonds, lead to energy dissipation. Most heterogeneities involved into various dry friction mechanisms are associated with small ratios of magnitudes and of characteristic lengths of the forces at the interface and in the bulk. This small ratio leads to an almost linear dependence of the friction force upon load (the Coulomb law). However, the heterogeneities lead also to non-linear and multiscale effects. Mapping of dry friction mechanisms is proposed based upon the characteristic length parameters. It is discussed also how hierarchical friction mechanisms lead to biological hierarchical surfaces with reduced or increased adhesion and friction. Current advances in nano- and bio-tribology reveal a growing number of hierarchical (multiscale) surfaces. From the lotus leaf and gecko foot to self-affine and textured engineering surfaces, the hierarchy plays a fundamental role in frictional energy dissipation."

abstract  ="The underlying theories interpreting wetting phenomena are still mainly focused on the Young{'}s equation{,} the Wenzel equation{,} and the Cassie–Baxter equation{,} despite the fact that wetting phenomena have been studied over the past decades. Based on these theories{,} people have understood that both surface chemical composition and its morphology can influence the contact angle of liquid droplets on solid surfaces. However{,} such equations are not sufficient to thoroughly explain the mechanisms of wetting phenomena{,} although they are still necessary. In this feature article{,} we review the theory{,} from the classical wetting models to the most recent theoretical advances{,} of superhydrophobic surfaces with regard to the wetting process{,} and some promising breakthroughs in the advance of the theory are proposed in the final section."}

  abstract={By resorting to the thick-chain model we discuss how the stretching response of a polymer is influenced by the self-avoidance entailed by its finite thickness. The characterization of the force versus extension curve for a thick chain is carried out through extensive stochastic simulations. The computational results are captured by an analytic expression that is used to fit experimental stretching measurements carried out on DNA and single-stranded RNA (poly-U) in various solutions. This strategy allows us to infer the apparent diameter of two biologically relevant polyelectrolytes, namely DNA and poly-U, for different ionic strengths. Due to the very different degrees of flexibility of the two molecules, the results provide insight into how the apparent diameter is influenced by the interplay between the (solution-dependent) Debye screening length and the polymers' 'bare' thickness. For DNA, the electrostatic contribution to the effective radius, Δ, is found to be about five times larger than the Debye screening length, consistent with previous theoretical predictions for highly charged stiff rods. For the more flexible poly-U chains the electrostatic contribution to Δ is found to be significantly smaller than the Debye screening length.}
